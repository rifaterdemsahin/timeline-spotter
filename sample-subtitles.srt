 (Upbeat Music)

2
01:03:00,933 --> 01:03:01,650
 for us.

3
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,599
 The standard tool is the free tier.

4
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,349
 If you don't want to spend any money, you

5
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,033
 are going to use the free tier.

6
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:09,300
 The next is the tooling.

7
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,383
 If you don't want to use any money, use

8
01:03:11,383 --> 01:03:14,416
 the standard kit and you will be able to

9
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,366
 use the Visual Studio

10
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:16,833
 and the GitHub for free.

11
01:03:17,183 --> 01:03:19,766
 This is the way to go for the starters.

12
01:03:20,066 --> 01:03:22,449
 Then if you want to have a pair pilot,

13
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,433
 you can definitely use the GitHub

14
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:26,949
 co-pilot to be able to do your job.

15
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:29,150
 But if you want something on your local

16
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:32,033
 that is going to run with the agents on

17
01:03:32,033 --> 01:03:34,550
 your local, then using something like a

18
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,266
 cursor AI makes more sense.

19
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,516
 Think about this like an evolution.

20
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,733
 I use three of them and I will be able to

21
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:43,033
 swap between each other.

22
01:03:43,216 --> 01:03:45,550
 The visual, a machine that is 3D printing

23
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,216
 in an identical copy of the host.

24
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:49,566
 The foundation is the

25
01:03:49,566 --> 01:03:51,116
 reusable delivery pilot.

26
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,750
 I'm creating the repositories, I'm

27
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,449
 cloning myself and you learn how to clone

28
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:57,650
 yourself in the future.

29
01:03:58,349 --> 01:04:00,666
 By being able to learn how to clone

30
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:02,250
 yourself, you are going to

31
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,816
 move between the AI providers.

32
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:07,150
 I will show you how to glue this in a

33
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,383
 free environment and

34
01:04:08,383 --> 01:04:10,133
 also show this how to

35
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:13,333
 The host is holding a massive golden

36
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:17,466
 microphone that is too heavy to carry.

37
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:19,516
 People so close to me are struggling

38
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:22,883
 right now and yet I'm talking about the

39
01:04:22,883 --> 01:04:24,250
 engineering concepts of

40
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,833
 building 240 workflows.

41
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,266
 I'm just scaring people off.

42
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,750
 Last week, I made a decision.

43
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,316
 I'm going to pivot, building tools with

44
01:04:33,316 --> 01:04:35,833
 no code and no technical background.

45
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:39,066
 So you can become a delivery pilot and

46
01:04:39,066 --> 01:04:39,983
 make sure you are

47
01:04:39,983 --> 01:04:42,166
 transforming in the AIH.

48
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:44,599
 Everybody will get their jet pack on and

49
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:45,883
 they are gonna look ahead.

50
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:47,833
 I'm talking with someone, a friend of

51
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,000
 mine who escaped from the war.

52
01:04:50,783 --> 01:04:53,883
 Think about this like a giant glass that

53
01:04:53,883 --> 01:04:56,683
 she's outside and there's no code tools

54
01:04:56,683 --> 01:04:58,233
 for her to survive

55
01:04:58,433 --> 01:05:00,333
 this billion dollar war.

56
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:02,733
 I'm unlikely to get this golden

57
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:05,949
 microphone anyway from the engineers in

58
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:07,849
 the enterprises that I work for.

59
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:11,099
 They are moving like zombie snails in a

60
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:14,266
 10 year race to be able to get there for

61
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:15,516
 the AI transformation.

62
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,166
 There's a massive

63
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:20,183
 resistance, but we are closing the gap.

64
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,066
 I want everybody to be able to use the

65
01:05:23,066 --> 01:05:26,133
 simulations, do their checklist, clone

66
01:05:26,133 --> 01:05:28,766
 the repos, fork them and create their

67
01:05:28,766 --> 01:05:31,116
 bespoke applications using the AI.

68
01:05:31,116 --> 01:05:32,199
 The scene, the statue

69
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:33,900
 hall, the screen capture,

70
01:05:34,466 --> 01:05:35,616
 static rules.

71
01:05:35,616 --> 01:05:38,849
 A visual, a row of a frozen statues,

72
01:05:39,316 --> 01:05:41,633
 static versus a character

73
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,883
 made out of liquid mercury,

74
01:05:43,883 --> 01:05:45,900
 changing shapes like the terminator.

75
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:46,699
 It's dynamic.

76
01:05:46,816 --> 01:05:48,916
 The static rules are easily broken.

77
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:50,783
 If you look at these rules you are going

78
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:53,250
 to see that they are hard-coded, rigid

79
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,716
 and can easily break at day

80
01:05:55,716 --> 01:05:57,333
 one when the things change.

81
01:05:58,016 --> 01:06:00,816
 dynamic rules is like liquid mercury

82
01:06:01,316 --> 01:06:03,250
 rather than stone statues.

83
01:06:03,933 --> 01:06:06,716
 This is our key in the age of AI, I

84
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:08,933
 expect everybody to be able to create

85
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:10,099
 their own applications.

86
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,933
 We build these bespoke apps using

87
01:06:12,933 --> 01:06:16,033
 anti-gravity, using cloth so everybody

88
01:06:16,033 --> 01:06:17,900
 can scout their own reality.

89
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:19,483
 You are not just bonded with

90
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:20,866
 the schools, the old system.

91
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,900
 We want the power that becomes our heavy

92
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,016
 iron chain that is difficult to escape,

93
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,933
 the school system, the things that we

94
01:06:29,933 --> 01:06:30,949
 learned in the past.

95
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:32,300
 They are right now obsolete.

96
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,400
 We are going to break our chains and we

97
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,683
 will be able to build our own solutions.

98
01:06:36,683 --> 01:06:39,366
 The scene, the clone lab, the screen

99
01:06:39,366 --> 01:06:41,699
 capture, terminal git clone demo.

100
01:06:41,716 --> 01:06:41,733
 The

101
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,516
 So getting GitHub repositories to your

102
01:06:47,516 --> 01:06:50,366
 local powerhouse is the key for us to be

103
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:52,400
 able to run these agents.

104
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:54,650
 What we are going to do it is the magic

105
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,150
 of the delivery pilot

106
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:57,650
 template is the key.

107
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,983
 First of all, we are going to clone that

108
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:02,316
 repository to an empty folder.

109
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:04,866
 Once we have the clone repository, we are

110
01:07:04,866 --> 01:07:07,250
 going to use the agent to be able to

111
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,383
 execute the commands.

112
01:07:08,383 --> 01:07:09,783
 Then we are going to have

113
01:07:09,783 --> 01:07:11,300
 the tooling system for us.

114
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:14,483
 We are going to see we could either use a

115
01:07:14,483 --> 01:07:16,099
 standard tool or we could

116
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,933
 definitely use other tools for us.

117
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:20,883
 The standard tool is the free tier.

118
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,633
 If you don't want to spend any money, you

119
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:25,316
 are going to use the free tier.

120
01:07:25,316 --> 01:07:26,566
 The next is the tooling.

121
01:07:26,566 --> 01:07:28,683
 If you don't want to use any money, use

122
01:07:28,683 --> 01:07:31,699
 the standard kit and you will be able to

123
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:32,650
 use the Visual Studio

124
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,116
 and the GitHub for free.

125
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,050
 This is the way to go for the starters.

126
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,733
 Then if you want to have a pair pilot,

127
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,716
 you can definitely use the GitHub

128
01:07:41,716 --> 01:07:44,233
 co-pilot to be able to do your job.

129
01:07:44,483 --> 01:07:46,433
 But if you want something on your local

130
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:49,316
 that is going to run with the agents on

131
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:51,833
 your local, then using something like a

132
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:53,550
 cursor AI makes more sense.

133
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:55,800
 Think about this like an evolution.

134
01:07:56,266 --> 01:07:59,016
 I use three of them and I will be able to

135
01:07:59,016 --> 01:08:00,316
 swap between each other.

136
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,833
 The visual, a machine that is 3D printing

137
01:08:03,066 --> 01:08:05,500
 in an identical copy of the host.

138
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,849
 The foundation is the

139
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,383
 reusable delivery pilot.

140
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:11,033
 I'm creating the repositories, I'm

141
01:08:11,033 --> 01:08:13,733
 cloning myself and you learn how to clone

142
01:08:13,733 --> 01:08:14,933
 yourself in the future.

143
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,949
 By being able to learn how to clone

144
01:08:17,949 --> 01:08:19,533
 yourself, you are going to

145
01:08:19,533 --> 01:08:21,100
 move between the AI providers.

146
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,433
 I will show you how to glue this in a

147
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:27,216
 free environment and also show this how

148
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:29,533
 to be able to do this with the agents.

149
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:32,816
 This is like the giant floating islands.

150
01:08:32,816 --> 01:08:34,433
 You are going to be able to

151
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:36,500
 move from one to the other.

152
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:39,116
 So you are going to learn how to operate

153
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:41,750
 it on your local and how to operate in an

154
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,016
 enterprise environment

155
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,033
 when it is time for the

156
01:08:46,133 --> 01:08:47,766
 and the internet kill switch.

157
01:08:48,033 --> 01:08:49,949
 This is the master part that we are going

158
01:08:49,949 --> 01:08:53,500
 to be able to deploy our website by

159
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,466
 understanding the GitHub actions.

160
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:58,100
 good part of the GitHub actions is every

161
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,233
 change that we do, we will be able to

162
01:09:00,233 --> 01:09:02,250
 deploy this using a CI

163
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,483
 CD pipeline as a web page.

164
01:09:03,516 --> 01:09:07,333
 And we will be able to see the live

165
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,533
 execution type and the

166
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:11,333
 live website in our system.

167
01:09:11,683 --> 01:09:13,300
 So we can see all of our

168
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,483
 changes at once very easily.

169
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:18,883
 We have two thousand three minutes, that

170
01:09:18,883 --> 01:09:21,500
 is the key for us, that we can deploy

171
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,233
 these minutes to web pages.

172
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:25,916
 If you go to an enterprise, you are going

173
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,966
 to see that there will be self runners

174
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:29,383
 happening in the

175
01:09:29,383 --> 01:09:31,183
 background that is going to work

176
01:09:31,183 --> 01:09:34,500
 Or you can go to alternatives and buy the

177
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,266
 enterprise solutions to be able to deploy

178
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:38,699
 with optimized speed.

179
01:09:39,016 --> 01:09:41,100
 Because this is going to be slow but

180
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,316
 useful for you to be

181
01:09:42,316 --> 01:09:43,566
 able to do your changes.

182
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:46,399
 You can go to the enterprise, get GitHub

183
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:49,166
 co-pilot and get more minutes.

184
01:09:49,633 --> 01:09:52,100
 Or you can get your own bugs to be able

185
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,566
 to do everything yourself.

186
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,250
 So this is going to give

187
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,500
 you much more flexibility.

188
01:09:56,883 --> 01:09:59,466
 But always start from the GitHub actions.

189
01:09:59,766 --> 01:10:00,383
 transformation.

190
01:10:00,383 --> 01:10:02,500
 The scene, the nursery host arrow.

191
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:04,649
 A visual, a giant GitHub logo

192
01:10:04,649 --> 01:10:07,149
 acting as a baby's nightlight.

193
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:09,750
 If you are a mom or a dad putting kids to

194
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:10,766
 bed, like myself,

195
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,583
 consistency is your magic shield.

196
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:15,466
 Today, we are going to build something

197
01:10:15,466 --> 01:10:17,033
 that I'm using in my flat.

198
01:10:17,466 --> 01:10:19,783
 This workflow is a giant red

199
01:10:19,783 --> 01:10:21,216
 off lever for the internet.

200
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:24,500
 It lives and breathes inside GitHub.

201
01:10:25,033 --> 01:10:26,116
 It turns the internet

202
01:10:26,116 --> 01:10:27,933
 on and off in the flat.

203
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:30,366
 We are going to add special features,

204
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:32,966
 bespoke features for us to be able to

205
01:10:32,966 --> 01:10:35,966
 turn only one kid's internet, turn the

206
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:37,383
 other kid's internet on.

207
01:10:37,383 --> 01:10:38,833
 So we might start a fight,

208
01:10:39,116 --> 01:10:40,716
 but we know what we are doing.

209
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:42,816
 We are going to give this to the mom so

210
01:10:42,816 --> 01:10:44,883
 the mom can do the

211
01:10:44,883 --> 01:10:46,383
 updates that she wants.

212
01:10:46,383 --> 01:10:48,449
 The screen capture, Google MSFT.

213
01:10:48,533 --> 01:10:51,533
 A visual, a Google and a Microsoft logo

214
01:10:51,533 --> 01:10:54,633
 colored head and holding an Alexa speaker

215
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:56,216
 like a crystal ball.

216
01:10:56,233 --> 01:10:58,433
 I saw a colleague from my Microsoft days.

217
01:10:58,733 --> 01:11:00,949
 He mentioned, "Why don't you use a Google

218
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:03,100
 skills or Alexa skills?

219
01:11:03,466 --> 01:11:04,149
 They will always

220
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:05,133
 speak in the background."

221
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:07,050
 These are the skills that you are going

222
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:09,266
 to find out in your own use cases.

223
01:11:09,883 --> 01:11:10,616
 The delivery pilot

224
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:12,233
 framework, the simulations

225
01:11:12,233 --> 01:11:12,733
 and the

226
01:11:12,783 --> 01:11:14,833
 If you try to come up with the solutions

227
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,949
 yourself, such as using the Google Play,

228
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,666
 you are going to see that this is going

229
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:22,399
 to be a walled garden for you, which

230
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,083
 means you are going to be locked in to

231
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:26,233
 the system while you

232
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:27,399
 are trying to use it.

233
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:30,366
 There's all these skills that is already

234
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:32,000
 designed and you are going

235
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,416
 to have the privacy text.

236
01:11:34,216 --> 01:11:35,149
 You are going to share

237
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:36,449
 your data to the Google.

238
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:40,533
 Learning tools like Ozur is going to

239
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:42,649
 bring you overhead because you have to

240
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:46,000
 learn tools like Ozur and there's going

241
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
 to be lots of points that you have to

242
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,333
 learn to be able to run it and it might

243
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:51,816
 not be very straight forward

244
01:11:51,816 --> 01:11:53,233
 in your home lab environment.

245
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,800
 And you are going to go through all these

246
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,050
 constraints and the

247
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,583
 costs and the friction

248
01:11:58,583 --> 01:11:59,266
 of your waste.

249
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:01,466
 You are going to see that there is lots

250
01:12:01,466 --> 01:12:03,699
 of hardware that's going to get not used

251
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:06,750
 and you want to have a privacy and you

252
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,383
 want to be able to use something that you

253
01:12:09,383 --> 01:12:12,116
 own instead of you are renting it from

254
01:12:12,116 --> 01:12:13,966
 somebody else and you are going to have

255
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:15,949
 an infinite control on the

256
01:12:15,949 --> 01:12:17,300
 structure that you created.

257
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:24,066
 delivery structure is

258
01:12:24,066 --> 01:12:26,166
 for you to figure out.

259
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:27,616
 I'm creating the structure.

260
01:12:28,266 --> 01:12:30,266
 I'm showing you how I am doing it.

261
01:12:30,616 --> 01:12:32,899
 Your responsibility is take the delivery

262
01:12:32,899 --> 01:12:35,266
 pilot and go wherever you wanna go.

263
01:12:35,266 --> 01:12:36,633
 The scene, the engine room,

264
01:12:37,016 --> 01:12:38,833
 the host aero, the visual.

265
01:12:39,133 --> 01:12:40,733
 Host is standing in front of a clock

266
01:12:41,216 --> 01:12:41,966
 where the hands are

267
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:43,866
 spinning at 1000X speed.

268
01:12:43,866 --> 01:12:46,633
 We are triggering an AI transformation or

269
01:12:46,633 --> 01:12:49,816
 hands-on experience by building our own

270
01:12:49,816 --> 01:12:51,116
 solutions using the

271
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:52,216
 artificial intelligence.

272
01:12:52,816 --> 01:12:53,883
 We are in an ever

273
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:55,433
 spinning engine of learning.

274
01:12:55,699 --> 01:12:56,966
 I started with the books.

275
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:58,416
 I read the basic.

276
01:12:59,033 --> 01:13:00,100
 Right now we have the

277
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,033
 smartest operators in the room.

278
01:13:02,483 --> 01:13:04,933
 All the books, all the videos are inside

279
01:13:04,933 --> 01:13:07,916
 the AI agents waiting for you to be able

280
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,316
 to be turn your

281
01:13:09,316 --> 01:13:11,750
 creativity into something gold.

282
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:14,050
 The scene, the kitchen table, the screen

283
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:16,550
 capture and the home network dashboard.

284
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,766
 The AI learning frontier, we are going to

285
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:21,516
 use all these large language models to

286
01:13:21,516 --> 01:13:23,016
 knowledge acquisition.

287
01:13:23,383 --> 01:13:25,816
 We are going to use the quote "Capture,

288
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,433
 organize, distill and express framework"

289
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:32,066
 and all the data will come as a capture

290
01:13:32,066 --> 01:13:33,816
 for you while we are learning.

291
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:36,666
 So, you are going to see Claude solves

292
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:37,750
 most of the problems.

293
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:39,516
 Then there is the chat GPT.

294
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:41,833
 You can easily say why chat GPT is not

295
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:44,250
 the first because Claude's models are

296
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,750
 very very focused on it.

297
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:47,233
 Then my favorite, the

298
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:48,550
 free one, the deep seek.

299
01:13:49,033 --> 01:13:50,850
 Any time that you need a large language

300
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,833
 model you know that it is there and it

301
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:55,466
 has lots of potential and if you want

302
01:13:55,466 --> 01:13:58,100
 something versatile like the Gemini that

303
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,600
 you can use nano banana to create images

304
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,600
 you can do slides plus you can do the

305
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,716
 code as well on the Gemini

306
01:14:05,716 --> 01:14:08,100
 and it is a big free tier as

307
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:09,666
 Why the Claude is good?

308
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:11,616
 Why we need to use the Claude?

309
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:14,066
 Because the reasoning layer is top notch

310
01:14:14,066 --> 01:14:18,466
 with the Sonnet 3.5, right now 4.5 and

311
01:14:18,466 --> 01:14:22,216
 4.6 we see that it is able to solve the

312
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:23,466
 most complex problems.

313
01:14:23,466 --> 01:14:25,949
 As we mentioned chat GPT is versatile.

314
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:29,516
 It is the leading tool in the AI space.

315
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:31,199
 We will be able to use it.

316
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,000
 I mostly use it as a search engine for

317
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,350
 myself and you can do

318
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,916
 this by a Chrome extension.

319
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:39,149
 The deep seek is the coding disruptor.

320
01:14:39,149 --> 01:14:40,750
 You are going to see that this free

321
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,399
 structure that is going to help you a lot

322
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:46,266
 and you should be able to copy paste this

323
01:14:46,266 --> 01:14:49,516
 code outside of the editors which you

324
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:51,066
 want to use it for free.

325
01:14:51,066 --> 01:14:53,649
 The last but not the least the Gemini is

326
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:56,316
 the versatile platform which integrates

327
01:14:56,316 --> 01:14:58,866
 with all these tools and you will be able

328
01:14:58,866 --> 01:15:01,283
 to see the Google does not want to lose

329
01:15:01,283 --> 01:15:02,983
 the search it will give you images.

330
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:04,983
 It is going to give you videos.

331
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:07,100
 It is going to give you a coding editor

332
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,583
 for them to be able to

333
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:10,016
 keep the search business.

334
01:15:10,016 --> 01:15:12,033
 For you to be able to master the code in

335
01:15:12,033 --> 01:15:14,566
 seconds what you need to do it is you

336
01:15:14,566 --> 01:15:16,833
 need to be able to explain yourself in

337
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:18,699
 English very very easily.

338
01:15:18,933 --> 01:15:21,699
 Understand the AI is generating it and

339
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:23,899
 you need to learn how to debug this

340
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:26,149
 yourself to be able to get better at

341
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:28,000
 So let's talk about the free tier.

342
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,766
 All of these free tiers have a use case.

343
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:35,333
 I start with the chat GPT when it gets

344
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:37,000
 finished I will go to deep seek.

345
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,366
 If that doesn't work I will go to Gemini

346
01:15:39,366 --> 01:15:42,233
 and if I can't really solve something I

347
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:44,649
 might need to pay money for the cloud if

348
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:46,833
 my free subscription is ending.

349
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,699
 Also don't forget all of these have

350
01:15:48,699 --> 01:15:51,066
 different skills and we are going to see

351
01:15:51,066 --> 01:15:53,199
 with those different skills coding

352
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,916
 reasoning creativity and ecosystem there

353
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:58,100
 are different use cases for different

354
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,899
 types of large language models.

355
01:15:59,899 --> 01:16:01,583
 So what you need to do it is you need to

356
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:04,050
 make sure you focus on learning and you

357
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:06,750
 set a path for yourself by using all

358
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:09,949
 these tools go to their website plus also

359
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:11,250
 use their mobile app

360
01:16:11,683 --> 01:16:14,583
 A visual, a kitchen table flowing with

361
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,683
 100 tablets like a

362
01:16:16,683 --> 01:16:18,199
 digital food getting served.

363
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:19,583
 It's a feast.

364
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,483
 Why not turn YouTube into a hobby?

365
01:16:21,716 --> 01:16:21,800
 This

366
01:16:21,949 --> 01:16:23,350
 a family oriented week.

367
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,533
 Instead of serving food,

368
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,133
 today we are serving tablets.

369
01:16:27,733 --> 01:16:30,533
 We are building these interfaces for our

370
01:16:30,533 --> 01:16:33,416
 use cases to manage the access in our

371
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:34,850
 household, in your flat.

372
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,016
 So think of this as a digital gatekeeper

373
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:41,316
 and you are going to build it using

374
01:16:41,316 --> 01:16:44,199
 cloth, using Gemini, using DeepSeek.

375
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,516
 You are going to be the one who is going

376
01:16:46,516 --> 01:16:48,833
 to be in charge and you are going to have

377
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:51,766
 this pure creativity on your side.

378
01:16:51,766 --> 01:16:52,466
 The scene, the power

379
01:16:52,466 --> 01:16:54,816
 station, the power screen capture.

380
01:16:55,283 --> 01:16:56,866
 We have the router table.

381
01:16:56,966 --> 01:16:59,300
 A visual, a lightning bolt being caught

382
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,050
 in a small glass bottle.

383
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,966
 If I flip the switch and track the

384
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:04,583
 lighting, I lose the

385
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,050
 target light instantly.

386
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:08,466
 So join me, learn the flow

387
01:17:08,466 --> 01:17:10,149
 with the speed of the waterfall

388
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:12,816
 and the clarity of the diamond.

389
01:17:12,816 --> 01:17:14,366
 This is your key moment.

390
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:17,116
 You are going to see that you will be

391
01:17:17,116 --> 01:17:20,016
 able to capture everything that you do if

392
01:17:20,016 --> 01:17:22,949
 you get your hands on and turn this on.

393
01:17:22,949 --> 01:17:25,699
 The scene, the tool shed screen, the

394
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:28,800
 capture, the GitHub and the tool demo.

395
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,766
 Visual, all visual toolbox where the

396
01:17:32,766 --> 01:17:34,233
 tools are literally

397
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:35,699
 vibrating with energy.

398
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:37,600
 Let's look at what I'm doing with the

399
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,166
 Internet Access Manager.

400
01:17:39,383 --> 01:17:41,583
 I'm trying to create it with my delivery

401
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,366
 pilot framework, so I can have a

402
01:17:44,366 --> 01:17:47,033
 framework on top of the system that I'm

403
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,916
 going to build, because this is going to

404
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:51,483
 be a bespoke solution for myself.

405
01:17:51,483 --> 01:17:53,949
 If we look down to this, we are going to

406
01:17:53,949 --> 01:17:56,666
 see that this is generated in an 8N, and

407
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:58,366
 I have all these different types of

408
01:17:58,366 --> 01:18:00,733
 triggers to be able to turn on the

409
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:03,316
 Internet and turn off the Internet, and I

410
01:18:03,316 --> 01:18:06,149
 have a logic that follows up and sends a

411
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:08,533
 telegram message and then email at the

412
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:10,916
 end, so I know that the Internet is on.

413
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:12,750
 This is my logic, this is

414
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,649
 my bespoke implementation.

415
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:17,500
 This is working behind my own system in

416
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,883
 the background where I ran

417
01:18:19,883 --> 01:18:22,516
 an edge router in the back.

418
01:18:22,516 --> 01:18:24,583
 Everybody will have a different router,

419
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:25,566
 so they are going to

420
01:18:25,566 --> 01:18:27,399
 program this in a different way.

421
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:29,966
 main thing that I'm doing is I have the

422
01:18:29,966 --> 01:18:32,733
 MAC addresses, and I'm going to add a

423
01:18:32,733 --> 01:18:35,866
 drop rule on here to be able to drop the

424
01:18:35,866 --> 01:18:37,300
 traffic that I don't want

425
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,266
 on here very, very easily.

426
01:18:39,283 --> 01:18:41,300
 But you are going to realize I have all

427
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,949
 the MAC addresses mapped to all of the

428
01:18:43,949 --> 01:18:46,183
 devices in the flat, so it is very

429
01:18:46,183 --> 01:18:48,733
 straightforward for me to be able to

430
01:18:48,733 --> 01:18:50,399
 start or stop a

431
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:51,766
 device getting the access.

432
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:54,616
 I have also created a user interface that

433
01:18:54,616 --> 01:18:57,366
 I mentioned on GitHub using the GitHub

434
01:18:57,366 --> 01:19:00,149
 Pages feature and deploying this on here,

435
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:02,699
 which one of the features is adding

436
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:04,483
 turning the Internet on, turning the

437
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:07,183
 Internet off, looking at the device list,

438
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:09,016
 because this is going to have the

439
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:11,733
 firewall policies, and I have all the

440
01:19:11,733 --> 01:19:13,733
 implementation guide for myself.

441
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:16,833
 And this is for my wife to be able to use

442
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:19,116
 it, because I do not want to give my wife

443
01:19:19,116 --> 01:19:21,399
 a complex solution where she has got

444
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:23,216
 issues turning on and

445
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:24,383
 turning off the Internet.

446
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,883
 Because this is an agentic system, as we

447
01:19:26,883 --> 01:19:29,016
 see on here, we are going to see that

448
01:19:29,016 --> 01:19:31,750
 most of the time this works automatically

449
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,416
 in the background, and new rules are

450
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:36,083
 coming up all the time.

451
01:19:36,283 --> 01:19:37,633
 So the rules are dynamic,

452
01:19:37,949 --> 01:19:39,716
 I can always extend them.

453
01:19:39,716 --> 01:19:42,033
 Because this is an agentic system as we

454
01:19:42,033 --> 01:19:44,216
 see on here, we are going to see that

455
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:46,883
 most of the time this works automatically

456
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:49,583
 in the background and new rules are

457
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,383
 coming up all the time.

458
01:19:51,383 --> 01:19:52,300
 So the rules are

459
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,416
 dynamic, I can always extend

460
01:19:54,533 --> 01:19:55,916
 There's two critical

461
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,316
 places that I can look.

462
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,166
 First of all, I can go to my commits in

463
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:02,766
 the GitHub repository, which is private,

464
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:03,750
 and see how many

465
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,350
 times I change the system.

466
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:07,949
 As we see on here, this has been changed

467
01:20:07,949 --> 01:20:10,833
 more than 37 times, and I have different

468
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:13,533
 rules coming up on different times.

469
01:20:13,533 --> 01:20:14,766
 As I said, this is going

470
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:16,233
 to evolve all the time.

471
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:17,949
 This is a bespoke solution.

472
01:20:18,266 --> 01:20:21,133
 I will always change, update, and remove

473
01:20:21,133 --> 01:20:22,316
 the existing features.

474
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,533
 While I'm adding new features, I will be

475
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:27,566
 able to see all my executions, and when

476
01:20:27,566 --> 01:20:29,283
 did it work, and when did it

477
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:31,133
 not work very, very easily.

478
01:20:31,133 --> 01:20:32,683
 As I have seen on

479
01:20:32,683 --> 01:20:34,333
 here, something happened.

480
01:20:34,633 --> 01:20:36,300
 I have updated the code base.

481
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,699
 For the last couple of

482
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,133
 days, it is not working.

483
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:40,316
 Normally, it was working.

484
01:20:40,866 --> 01:20:43,083
 I should be able to go down into this

485
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:45,800
 system, and be able to see that it was

486
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,300
 working in the past very easily.

487
01:20:48,533 --> 01:20:50,649
 I should be able to scroll down and see

488
01:20:50,649 --> 01:20:52,566
 this was working on here.

489
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:53,399
 I deployed something

490
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:55,683
 and broke the system down.

491
01:20:55,683 --> 01:20:58,216
 So I will be able to see how many times

492
01:20:58,216 --> 01:21:01,016
 this has worked in the past, and what did

493
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:02,566
 I need to do to be able to

494
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,883
 make this work easier for myself.

495
01:21:05,233 --> 01:21:07,333
 There are all these different use cases

496
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:09,500
 on here that I can add

497
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,116
 definitely onto the system.

498
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:13,916
 This is going to make my life much easier

499
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:16,733
 to be able to manage this system, such as

500
01:21:16,733 --> 01:21:19,899
 I added a device control on here to be

501
01:21:19,899 --> 01:21:21,316
 able to turn on and

502
01:21:21,316 --> 01:21:23,083
 off a specific device.

503
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:25,466
 That's a new feature that I'm trying to

504
01:21:25,466 --> 01:21:26,383
 add, but I have broken

505
01:21:26,383 --> 01:21:27,833
 other parts of the system.

506
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:30,633
 I need to make sure I'm always looking at

507
01:21:30,633 --> 01:21:32,333
 it and learning through this process.

508
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:34,616
 The main thing that you can do, I have

509
01:21:34,616 --> 01:21:36,750
 shared this in other videos, you can

510
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,216
 definitely come into here and set an

511
01:21:39,216 --> 01:21:42,183
 error workflow to make sure that if one

512
01:21:42,183 --> 01:21:44,800
 of your workflows is failing, you will be

513
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,283
 able to get a direct message.

514
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:47,516
 Here is my niche update.

515
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,300
 I'm using the memory palaces.

516
01:21:49,933 --> 01:21:51,399
 Let's transform all together.

517
01:21:51,966 --> 01:21:52,933
 Grab your hammer.

518
01:21:53,149 --> 01:21:54,916
 That is the gate that is

519
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:57,116
 vibrating and your compass.

520
01:21:57,116 --> 01:21:58,966
 It could be your programmable router.

521
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,366
 In my case, it is.

522
01:22:00,899 --> 01:22:01,983
 I'm using the NA10.

523
01:22:02,283 --> 01:22:03,333
 I'm using my compute.

524
01:22:03,866 --> 01:22:05,683
 In your case, it could be your laptop.

525
01:22:06,233 --> 01:22:08,116
 Find the things that is your own

526
01:22:08,116 --> 01:22:09,533
 environment in the

527
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:10,899
 delivery pilot structure.

528
01:22:11,416 --> 01:22:13,083
 Build your bespoke solutions.

529
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:14,883
 Apps, what you love.

530
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,133
 Do what you wanna do.

531
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:18,566
 Focus on learning.

532
01:22:19,066 --> 01:22:20,600
 Focus on self-learning for

533
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,233
 yourself, for your family.

534
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:24,399
 Let's look at the tool shed, a complete

535
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:27,199
 GitHub Toolbox for modern developers.

536
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,733
 The repository anatomy, mastering the

537
01:22:29,733 --> 01:22:31,566
 structure of the professional base.

538
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:35,233
 Once I do the delivery pilot, I always

539
01:22:35,233 --> 01:22:36,416
 start with the reel

540
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,100
 and end with the testing.

541
01:22:38,683 --> 01:22:39,583
 And there's all these

542
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:40,866
 stages come in the middle.

543
01:22:40,983 --> 01:22:43,399
 The structure to have an organized system

544
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:45,883
 is important to create a modular system

545
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:48,399
 where you can track your assets and you

546
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:50,899
 can separate your configuration and be

547
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:55,283
 able to do an X times N, meaning loss of

548
01:22:55,283 --> 01:22:56,883
 repositories with the

549
01:22:56,883 --> 01:22:58,750
 least amount of effort.

550
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,283
 While you are going to work on the

551
01:23:00,283 --> 01:23:01,866
 repost, the main thing that you are going

552
01:23:01,866 --> 01:23:05,016
 to get through is your ability to be able

553
01:23:05,016 --> 01:23:07,250
 to write everything in a readme file.

554
01:23:07,533 --> 01:23:10,266
 So this is the markdown format and you

555
01:23:10,266 --> 01:23:12,449
 are going to have always an operational

556
01:23:12,449 --> 01:23:15,166
 procedure for yourself how to use the

557
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:17,866
 repository in a hierarchical manner so

558
01:23:17,866 --> 01:23:19,466
 you can read and then

559
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:20,883
 study your environment.

560
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,149
 issues tab and the pull requests are the

561
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:27,183
 critical parts on GitHub where you are

562
01:23:27,183 --> 01:23:29,083
 going to work on one project, you are

563
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:30,883
 going to see there is lots of issues

564
01:23:30,883 --> 01:23:32,916
 coming up and things that are changing

565
01:23:33,066 --> 01:23:35,683
 and you have to be able to merge your

566
01:23:35,683 --> 01:23:38,516
 branches to make sure that you have one

567
01:23:38,516 --> 01:23:41,483
 trunk that is always green and make sure

568
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:43,183
 that you are always doing

569
01:23:43,183 --> 01:23:44,500
 the continuous integration.

570
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,133
 The collaboration

571
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:47,699
 function is the fork mechanism.

572
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,383
 Once you fork a repository what is

573
01:23:50,383 --> 01:23:52,216
 happening is you are getting all the code

574
01:23:52,216 --> 01:23:54,233
 pieces and you see all the

575
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:56,133
 history coming up in the project.

576
01:23:56,516 --> 01:23:59,233
 You will be upstream syncing and you will

577
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:01,016
 be able to open to contributions.

578
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,933
 You are going to create your

579
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:04,916
 own version of the program.

580
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,050
 If you look at the development cycle, you

581
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:09,133
 first clone the repo, you start

582
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:11,500
 customizing it, then you want to get

583
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,316
 certified, you want to be able to deploy,

584
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:14,649
 you want to be able to

585
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,466
 create your own program.

586
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:17,866
 Let's look at what is free.

587
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,066
 The GitHub part is completely free.

588
01:24:20,649 --> 01:24:22,733
 Downloading Visual Studio is free, having

589
01:24:22,733 --> 01:24:25,466
 a git repository is free and if you want

590
01:24:25,466 --> 01:24:27,766
 to run environments, different programs,

591
01:24:28,233 --> 01:24:30,366
 the docker is free for you.

592
01:24:30,449 --> 01:24:31,916
 The main start is you

593
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:34,300
 start always with zero capital.

594
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:36,883
 Once you start with zero capital, you

595
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:38,666
 don't have monthly investment on the

596
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:40,966
 system, you are mostly putting the money

597
01:24:40,966 --> 01:24:42,366
 into your journey

598
01:24:42,366 --> 01:24:44,483
 which you need to focus on.

599
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,533
 If we compare the free versions, you get

600
01:24:47,533 --> 01:24:49,216
 all the Visual Studio plugins.

601
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:52,583
 Once you go to paid IDs such as the

602
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:55,966
 JetBrains or use a GitHub co-pilot, you

603
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,133
 are going to spend more

604
01:24:57,133 --> 01:24:58,866
 money to be able to do more.

605
01:24:58,883 --> 01:25:01,366
 So these are going to come in once you

606
01:25:01,366 --> 01:25:04,033
 want to do more of the stuff and you want

607
01:25:04,033 --> 01:25:07,066
 to have dedicated timelines on here and

608
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:08,616
 advanced security features.

609
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,716
 But having private repos and being able

610
01:25:11,716 --> 01:25:14,449
 to build this on GitHub is always free.

611
01:25:34,516 --> 01:25:36,866
 The scene, the balcony, the host arrow.

612
01:25:36,866 --> 01:25:39,350
 Host looking out over the futuristic city

613
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:40,600
 being built by the

614
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,866
 drones using the simulations.

615
01:25:42,866 --> 01:25:44,199
 Every simulation

616
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:45,800
 starts with the assessment.

617
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,916
 Make sure that you take the assessment

618
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:49,483
 first, then go and watch

619
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:51,050
 the simulations video second.

620
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,166
 Once you launch the assessment, you are

621
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:55,566
 going to see all your skills gaps at

622
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:58,250
 start, so you need to understand where

623
01:25:58,250 --> 01:25:59,750
 you are gapping the issues.

624
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,399
 You watch the video on the top and at the

625
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:03,550
 bottom there's a checklist.

626
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:05,933
 Make sure that you are checking network

627
01:26:05,933 --> 01:26:08,333
 authentication profile resources.

628
01:26:08,616 --> 01:26:10,616
 With every video you are going to get a

629
01:26:10,616 --> 01:26:11,500
 different checklist.

630
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:14,033
 So this is vital for you to make sure

631
01:26:14,033 --> 01:26:15,966
 that you are able to sync

632
01:26:15,966 --> 01:26:17,716
 up with what is in the video.

633
01:26:17,716 --> 01:26:19,600
 Once you complete your simulation

634
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,149
 running, meaning you are going to have a

635
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:24,833
 program that runs in the background, that

636
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:26,166
 is the clone of this

637
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:28,750
 application that you can turn it on.

638
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,133
 This is the vital stage

639
01:26:30,133 --> 01:26:32,000
 for you to be able to turn

640
01:26:32,183 --> 01:26:33,983
 Once you are able to do this, you are

641
01:26:33,983 --> 01:26:35,949
 going to see that you will run this in

642
01:26:35,966 --> 01:26:38,500
 different amounts on Windows, iOS,

643
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,683
 Android, on code spaces.

644
01:26:40,683 --> 01:26:41,516
 Different environments

645
01:26:41,516 --> 01:26:43,316
 is very, very important.

646
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:46,350
 And you are going to soon realize this is

647
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,350
 not only one device that you are going to

648
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:50,600
 run, you are going to run a mesh of

649
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,300
 devices and they are going to get

650
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,600
 connected to each other.

651
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,616
 The dashboards are very critical.

652
01:26:55,866 --> 01:26:58,083
 I always encourage you to be able to

653
01:26:58,083 --> 01:27:00,733
 deploy a website and make sure that you

654
01:27:00,733 --> 01:27:03,766
 are doing it with the GitHub actions and

655
01:27:03,966 --> 01:27:05,866
 iterate on this all the time.

656
01:27:06,116 --> 01:27:08,516
 So this is going to give you the real

657
01:27:08,516 --> 01:27:11,050
 feeling of what you really need to

658
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:14,199
 Such as in my case, the kids devices and

659
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:16,750
 I'm responding to their controls and this

660
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:19,649
 process is always going to change because

661
01:27:19,649 --> 01:27:21,033
 I have kids, they are at

662
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:23,266
 three years old to nine years old.

663
01:27:23,699 --> 01:27:26,033
 The use cases for three years old is very

664
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:27,116
 different than the use

665
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:28,449
 cases in nine year old.

666
01:27:28,733 --> 01:27:31,483
 So I need to make sure I play the game by

667
01:27:31,483 --> 01:27:33,983
 their rules and understand what are my

668
01:27:33,983 --> 01:27:35,750
 requirements and what are my changes.

669
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,483
 Looking at the logs, the event streams on

670
01:27:38,483 --> 01:27:41,716
 the GitHub or the NA10 is very critical

671
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:43,800
 for you to understand the automatic

672
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,733
 triggers and the audit trail is very,

673
01:27:46,733 --> 01:27:48,516
 very important because at the end of

674
01:27:48,516 --> 01:27:50,383
 today, you want to have a secure

675
01:27:50,383 --> 01:27:53,016
 environment doing this and working like a

676
01:27:53,016 --> 01:27:55,566
 clock for you is very, very critical.

677
01:27:55,566 --> 01:27:57,433
 What will be your success metrics?

678
01:27:57,699 --> 01:27:58,883
 You want to make sure that you are

679
01:27:58,883 --> 01:28:01,449
 compliant, you have lots of accuracy.

680
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:02,550
 In the beginning, you

681
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,000
 might not start very current.

682
01:28:04,516 --> 01:28:05,933
 In the beginning, you might have more

683
01:28:05,933 --> 01:28:07,966
 latency because you are using free tools.

684
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,550
 And at the end of today, you want to have

685
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:13,116
 make sure you are learning through this

686
01:28:13,116 --> 01:28:14,266
 process, which is the

687
01:28:14,266 --> 01:28:15,633
 key for your self growth.

688
01:28:15,733 --> 01:28:17,250
 Building your own, that is

689
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,016
 the maximum that you can go.

690
01:28:20,466 --> 01:28:22,833
 To become a delivery pilot, what we want

691
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:25,133
 you is, we want you to be able to come

692
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,883
 out of this simulation and

693
01:28:27,883 --> 01:28:29,733
 build your own local environment.

694
01:28:29,733 --> 01:28:32,199
 So we start with cloning the repo first,

695
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:34,000
 then starting configuring.

696
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:37,066
 Make sure after you configure, you create

697
01:28:37,066 --> 01:28:38,016
 your own environment.

698
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:40,449
 I have built these simulations for you.

699
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:42,550
 Build the future with me.

700
01:28:42,766 --> 01:28:43,699
 Till next time.

701
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:44,516
 Love.

702
01:28:44,949 --> 01:28:45,483
 Bye-bye, bye-bye.
